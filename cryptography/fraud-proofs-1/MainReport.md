# Fraud Proofs - easier said than done?

The Bitcoin blockchain is, as of June 2018, approximately 173 Gigabytes in size [1]. This makes it nearly impossible for everyone to run a full Bitcoin node. In the original Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi recognised this and introduced the concept of a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) [2], in which he describes a technique that allows verification of payments using a lightweight client that doesn't need to download the entire Bitcoin blockchain, but rather only block headers [3].
